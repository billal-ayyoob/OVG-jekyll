                        <p>Every Occam camera is&nbsp;equipped with non-volatile EEPROM memory that is used to store&nbsp;calibration
                            data, along with&nbsp;other&nbsp;sensor, vision module, and user settings.</p>
                        <p>When our cameras ship with fixed optics such as the Omni series, they will be pre-calibrated
                            at factory time and the calibration will be stored on the camera’s memory. Using Indigo
                            Tools you can re-generate the calibration and overwrite the data that is held on the
                            camera.</p>
                        <p>If the calibration data is&nbsp;not set, it will be returned as canonical values (D=0,
                            K=eye(3), R=eye(3), T=0).&nbsp;For the parts that are&nbsp;non-canonical, the values for all
                            sensors will be within the&nbsp;same&nbsp;coordinate frame. For Omni cameras, the center of
                            the world is in the&nbsp;center of the sensor ring. For Array it depends on the calibration&nbsp;method
                            used, whether it is median position of&nbsp;calibration point set, or the first&nbsp;paired
                            camera.</p>

                        <p>When the&nbsp;driver for your device loads,&nbsp;it will read the calibration data from
                            non-volatile memory and&nbsp;make it accessible through the following settings that you can
                            read with the&nbsp;occamGetDeviceValuerv&nbsp;API call.</p>

                            camera. You can read the</p>
                        <p>OCCAM_SENSOR_COUNT</p>
                        <p>setting from the camera to determine the number of sensors. For Omni series this will be
                            fixed to 5, 10, or 15 depending on the configuration. For Array&nbsp;cameras&nbsp;it will
                            depend on the pairing&nbsp;configuration&nbsp;that you did or&nbsp;that was done at factory.
                            The “pairing” of cameras refers to grouping them&nbsp;under a single virtual device.&nbsp;The
                            sensor count&nbsp;of the virtual device will be the count of constituent devices.</p>

                        <p>The&nbsp;format of the calibration data is the same as is used in OpenCV, and is as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>–&nbsp;OCCAM_SENSOR_DISTORTION_COEFS# This is&nbsp;vector D of 5 coefficients indicating
                            radial and tangient coefficients representing the&nbsp;mapping from undistorted to distorted&nbsp;coordinates
                            in normalized camera&nbsp;space (X and Y varying in [-1,1]).</p>
                        <p>–&nbsp;OCCAM_SENSOR_INTRINSICS# This is the 3×3 matrix K of camera internal parameters in
                            this format: [fx,0,cx;0,fy,cy;0,0,1] where fx&nbsp;and fy are the focal length multiplied by
                            the mapping of&nbsp;pixel&nbsp;dimensions to&nbsp;metric dimensions (usually millimeters
                            depending on how&nbsp;the calibration&nbsp;tool is configured), and cx and cy are the&nbsp;principal
                            point of the camera.&nbsp;This matrix maps from&nbsp;normalized camera&nbsp;coordinates
                            (distorted or not)&nbsp;to&nbsp;original image coordinates.</p>
                        <p>–&nbsp;OCCAM_SENSOR_ROTATION# This is the 3×3 rotation matrix R&nbsp;indicating the rotation&nbsp;part
                            of the mapping from world coordinates to normalized camera space.</p>
                        <p>– OCCAM_SENSOR_TRANSLATION# This is the 3×1 translation vector T&nbsp;indicating the
                            pre-rotated&nbsp;translation part of the&nbsp;mapping from world coordinates to normalized
                            camera space.</p>
                        <p>The full&nbsp;camera model used is the same as in OpenCV, and is also the&nbsp;standard
                            Hartley/Zisserman projective camera model:</p>
