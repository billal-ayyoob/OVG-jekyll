                        returned in original condition.  OVG will return to Customer any Products displaying any misuse
                        or damage or otherwise not in original condition.  If applicable, Products must be returned in
                        original manufacturer’s packaging.  Products should be packaged for shipping in a separate

                    </li>
                    <li>g) Customer is responsible for all shipping costs on returns for any reason; original shipping
                        charges will not be refunded.
                    </li>
                    <li>h) OVG may in its sole discretion issue refunds in either: (1) the same form as Customer’s
                        original payment for the Products, or (2) may offer Customer OVG in-store credit which may be
                        used to purchase other Products and will expire within a period of one (1) year or as written
                        upon the in-store credit issurance document.

                    including the applicable federal laws of the United States, but excluding that body of law
                    applicable to choice of law.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
                    of Goods and any legislation implementing such convention, if otherwise applicable, shall not apply
                    to any order or sale.  Customer hereby consents, attorns and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
                    of the courts of the State of Colorado, in the forum of Boulder, Colorado, for any suit, action or

                <h2>10. WARRANTIES</h2>
                <p>All Products, unless specifically stated within the Product page, marketing materials or invoice,
                    include a two (2) year limited warranty for parts and labour on material and manufacturing defects,
                    and a corresponding period of e-mail technical support.  Warranty only applies to original Purchaser
                    of OVG Products (“Customer”).  OVG will at its option either repair or replace the damaged unit.
                     OVG does not warrant compatibility of Products with non-OVG products, including but not limited to
                    integrations that may be advertised with the Product.  Warranty is void if any proprietary labeling
                    is removed.  Repaired or replaced Products are covered for the remainder of the original Product
                    warranty period or 90 Days whichever period is longer. OVG shall not be responsible for any defect
                    in the Products due to physical damage to the Products as a result of improper handling during or
                    after shipment, misuse, neglect, improper installation or operation (including but not limited to
                    radioactive or other dangerous environments, mishandling electrical equipment with static shocks,
                    etc.), repair, alteration, accident or for any other cause not attributable to defective workmanship
                    on the part of OVG. OVG EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
                    WITHOUT LIMITATION IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>
                <h2>11. REPAIR SERVICES</h2>
                <p>Repair services may be requested in writing via support@occamvisiongroup.com.  Customer will pay to
                    any repair fees assessed by OVG for Products that are not covered by the Warranty described in
                    Section 10 above.  Repaired Products will have a Hardware Warranty period of 90 days from the date
                    of shipment.  OVG may, at its discretion, exclude from this repair policy any Products that: a) have
                    been, or show any signs of being, misused, damaged or modified by Customer; or b) are beyond
                    reasonable reparability.</p>

                <h2>13. WAIVER</h2>
                <p>Failure of OVG to insist upon strict performance of any provisions hereof shall not be deemed a

                <h2>14. SEVERABILITY</h2>
                <p>To the extent that any provision, portion or extent of this Agreement is deemed to be invalid,

                    government intervention, delayed issuance of export licenses, embargoes, strikes, labour
                    difficulties, equipment failures, or any other causes beyond the control of OVG.</p>
                <h2>16. HEADINGS</h2>
                <p>The section headings used herein are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the

                <h2>17. ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h2>

                    hereto. These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between OVG and Customer with
                    respect to the purchase of Products.  THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE INTENDED TO SUPPLEMENT, BUT ARE
                    EXPRESSLY SUBORDINATE AND SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN ALL APPLICABLE SOFTWARE
                    LICENSE AGREEMENTS AS WELL AS TO ANY LICENSE, DEVELOPMENT, SUPPORT, BETA TEST, EVALUATION AND
                    DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT, OR ANY OTHER WRITTEN SALES AGREEMENT (&#8220;THE AGREEMENTS&#8221;)
                    PREVIOUSLY OR SUBSEQUENTLY ENTERED INTO IN WRITING BETWEEN THE CUSTOMER AND OVG AND AS SIGNED BY ALL
                    PARTIES HERETO.  THE AGREEMENTS SHALL SUPERCEDE ANY INCONSISTENT PROVISIONS IN THESE TERMS AND
                    CONDITIONS IN RESPECT OF THE SPECIFIC PRODUCTS TO WHICH THEY RELATE WHILE THE AGREEMENTS ARE
                    SUBSISTING.  Any terms and conditions contained in or attached to purchase orders submitted by
                    Customer do not form part of The Agreements, and any such terms and conditions are hereby expressly
                    rejected by OVG.</p>
                <h2>18. CUSTOM CAMERAS AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS</h2>
                <p>Unless otherwise agreed to expressly in a writing as agreed to with written signatures on behalf of
                    OVG and Customer which shall refer explicitly  to this Agreement and is in respect to customized
                    cameras and/or professional services (hereinafter referred to each as “Custom Camera” and
                    “Professional Services”) purchased hereunder, the following terms shall apply.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a) Acceptance.   By ordering or accepting professional services and/or a customized or custom
                        camera from OVG, Customer agrees that Customer has read and understood this Agreement and this
                        Section 18 (Custom Cameras and Professional Services Terms &amp; Conditions).
                    </li>
                    <li>b) Term.   The term of Professional Services shall be as set forth in a separate statement or
                        scope of work (“SOW”) that is mutually agreed to by the parties and referred to within the paid
                        invoice or paid quote.
                    </li>
                    <li>c) Scope of Services.   The project scope will consist of Professional Services and/or Custom
                        Camera identified on your paid invoice or paid quote.
                    </li>
                    <li>d) Out of Scope Services.  OVG shall not be responsible for Service outside the scope of the
                        Professional Services described on the paid invoice or paid quote.  Any additional services
                        discussed or implied that are not defined explicitly and expressly by the paid quote or paid
                        invoice shall be considered out of scope.
                    </li>
                    <li>e) Changes to Services.  Changes to the scope of Services must be documented and agreed upon by
                        the parties in a change order. If the changes cause an increase or decrease in any charges or
                        cause a scheduling change from that originally agreed upon, an equitable adjustment in the
                        charges or schedule will be agreed upon by the parties and included in the change order, signed
                        by both parties.
                    </li>
                    <li>f) Delays.  If any delays are caused by Customer, Customer will be responsible for any costs
                        incurred by OVG in preparing for the performance of the Professional Services, and OVG will be
                        entitled to recover these costs from Customer, including but not limited to travel related
                        costs, additional hardware costs, development costs, software costs, and all other costs not
                        stated here, etc.  Non-performance or delay by OVG of OVG obligations under this Agreement or
                        any separate SOW or paid invoice or paid quote will be excused if and to the extent the
                        non-performance or delay results directly from the failure by Customer to perform Customer
                        responsibilities. If any failure or delay by Customer to perform any of Customer
                        responsibilities prevents or delays our performance of OVG obligations under this Agreement, we
                        will be entitled to a reasonable extension of time to the applicable performance dates to
                        reflect the extent of the impact of the failure or delay by Customer.
                    </li>
                    <li>g) Customer Responsibilities.  OVG’s successful performance of the Professional Services depends
                        upon Customer:
                        <ul>
                            <li>i. Making available Customer relevant systems for assessment by OVG prior;</li>
                            <li>ii. Ensuring that prior to OVG assessment of relevant systems that Customer relevant
                                systems meet any and all requirements as set forth in separate SOW and/or paid invoice
                                and/or paid quote.  This shall include making any required modifications, upgrades or
                                alterations to Customer hardware, facilities, systems and networks related to OVG
                                performance of the Professional Services prior to Professional Service;

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>h) Access to Systems to Perform and Test Services.  Customer authorizes OVG, OVG independent
                        contractors, or consultants to access Customer relevant systems solely for the purpose of
                        performing the Professional Services.  Customer is responsible for, and assumes the risk of any
                        problems, delays, losses, claims, or expenses resulting from the content, accuracy,
                        completeness, and consistency of all data, materials, and information supplied by Customer or
                        third party that Customer has involved.
                    </li>
                    <li>i) Installation.  A separate SOW or paid invoice or paid quote may include all environmental
                        specifications that must be met in order for use of the Professional Services and related OVG
                        products, including but not limited to Custom or Customized Cameras.  Prior to delivery of all
                        OVG products in relation to the Professional Services, Customer must prepare installation of all
                        relevant software and/or systems in accordance with the environmental specifications as set
                        forth in the separate SOW or paid invoice or paid quote (“Installation Site”).  Following the
                        installation of the OVG products, Customer is solely responsible for maintaining the
                        Installation Site where the OVG products have been installed in accordance with the
                        environmental specifications set forth in the separate SOW or paid invoice or paid quote,
                        including but not limited to any and all relevant systems.  In the event that there are any
                        updates or modifications to the OVG products, including the environmental specifications for the
                        OVG products, OVG will provide the updates or modifications when they are generally released by
                        OVG to our customers as set forth in our support pages.
                    </li>
                    <li>j) Acceptance of OVG Delivery.   If, after delivery of OVG products related to Professional
                        Services, Customer reasonably believes that OVG did not complete the Professional Services in
                        substantial conformance with these terms as set forth in this Section 18, Customer must notify
                        OVG in writing of Customer’s specific reasons for rejection of the Professional Services within
                        7 calendar days from delivery of OVG products related to Professional Services and/or
                        Professional Services as set forth in a specified delivery date in a separate SOW or paid
                        invoice or paid quote.  If we do not receive a written notification of the reasons for the
                        rejection of the performance of the Professional Services from you within 7 calendar days of
                        delivery of the OVG products and/or Professional Services to you, the absence of your response
                        will constitute your affirmative acceptance of the Services, and a waiver of any right of
                        rejection.
                    </li>
                    <li>k) OVG Ownership.   Customer acknowledges and agrees that OVG shall retain and own all right,
                        title and interest and all intellectual property rights (including copyrights, trade secrets,
                        trade-marks and patent rights) in and to any and all Professional Services, software, hardware,
                        firmware, etc. and all other materials or intellectual property not herein referenced used by
                        OVG to provide the Professional Services except as previously owned by Customer as evidenced
                        with Customer’s documentation and records (collectively, the “OVG  Materials”) and all copies
                        thereof and customizations and modifications thereto, and that nothing herein transfers or
                        conveys to Customer any ownership right, title or interest in or to the OVG Materials or to any
                        copy thereof or any license right with respect to same not expressly granted herein. Customer
                        agrees that it will not, either during or after the termination of this Agreement, contest or
                        challenge the ownership of the intellectual property rights in the OVG Materials by OVG.
                         Customer understands and agrees that Professional Services work may be incorporated into OVG
                        work as provided to other Customers, as well as other software or hardware sold to public.
                    </li>
                    <li>l) Limitation of Liability.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL BE SUBJECT TO TERMS AS SET FORTH IN
                        SECTION 12 OF THIS AGREEMENT, EXCEPT THAT FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES OVG’S LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER
                        FOR ANY REASON AND UPON ANY CAUSE OF ACTION WHATSOEVER WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID
                        TO OVG UNDER THIS SECTION FOR THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES IN THE ONE (1) MONTH PRECEDING THE
                        CLAIM.  CUSTOM OR CUSTOMIZED CAMERAS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE PER SECTION 8 OF THIS AGREEMENT.
                    </li>
                    <li>m) Confidential Information.
                        <ul>
                            <li>i. Each party (“Recipient”) acknowledges that confidential information (including trade
                                secrets and confidential technical, financial and business information of the other
                                party (“Discloser”) may be exchanged between the parties pursuant to provision of
                                Professional Services as set forth in this Section 18 (collectively, “Confidential
                                Information”). Recipient shall use no less than the same means it uses to protect its
                                similar confidential and proprietary information, but in any event not less than
                                reasonable means, to prevent the disclosure and to protect the confidentiality of the
                                Confidential Information of Discloser. Recipient agrees that it will not disclose or use
                                the Confidential Information of Discloser except for the purposes of this Agreement and
                                as authorized herein. Recipient will promptly report to Discloser any unauthorized use
                                or disclosure of Discloser’s Confidential Information that Recipient becomes aware of
                                and provide reasonable assistance to Discloser (or its licensors) in the investigation
                                and prosecution of any such unauthorized use or disclosure.
                            </li>
                            <li>ii.  Notwithstanding Section 18(m)(i) above, Recipient may use or disclose the
                                Confidential Information to the extent that such Confidential Information is: (a)
                                already known by Recipient without an obligation of confidentiality, (b) publicly known
                                or becomes publicly known through no unauthorized act of Recipient, (c) rightfully
                                received from a third party without any obligation of confidentiality, (d) independently
                                developed by Recipient without use of the Confidential Information of the Discloser, (e)
                                approved by Discloser for disclosure, or (f) required to be disclosed pursuant to a
                                requirement of a governmental agency or law so long as Recipient provides Discloser with
                                notice of such requirement prior to any such disclosure and takes steps reasonably
                                necessary to maintain the information in confidence.
                            </li>
                            <li>iii.  Recipient shall, and shall cause all of its employees, contractors and consultants
                                who have access to Confidential Information of Discloser to, safeguard and maintain the
                                Confidential Information of Discloser in strict confidence and shall not, and shall
                                cause its employees, contractors and consultants not to, disclose, provide, or make such
                                Confidential Information or any part thereof available in any form or medium to any
                                third party person except to Recipient’s employees, contractors and consultants who have
                                a need to access such Confidential Information in order to enable Recipient to exercise
                                its rights under this Agreement. Customer agrees not to: (a) disclose to third parties
                                (whether in writing or orally) any data related to the OVG Services, and (b) use OVG’s
                                Confidential Information to create any computer software or documentation that is
                                substantially similar to the OVG software or OVG hardware.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>n)  Right to Perform Services For Others. Customer recognizes that OVG is in the business of
                        providing computer, software, and hardware services and may perform services for other persons
                        similar to Customer. Subject to OVG confidentiality obligations pursuant to Section 18(m), OVG
                        retains the right and nothing shall prevent OVG from using any ideas, concepts, methods,
                        processes, know-how, organization, techniques, hardware or any software, including OVG
                        Materials, in providing any services to any third party.
                    </li>
                    <li>o) Disclaimer of Warranty.  CUSTOM AND CUSTOMIZED CAMERAS AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES ARE EXCLUDED
                        FROM ALL WARRANTIES AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 10 (WARRANTIES).  OVG DOES NOT MAKE AND HEREBY
                        DISCLAIM, AND CUSTOMER EXPRESSLY WAIVES ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARDS TO OVG PRODUCTS PROVIDED
                        WITH PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND ALL WARRANTIES REGARDING PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, EXPRESSED OR

                        THAT RELY ON THIRD PARTY SERVICES OR PRODUCTS, AND/OR (iii) PROFESSIONAL SERVICES THAT INTEGRATE

                    </li>
                    <li>p) Term. The term of Professional Services will commence on dates as agreed to by Customer in
